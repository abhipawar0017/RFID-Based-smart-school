# RFID-Based-smart-school
This project will implement an RFID-based attendance system and integrate it with Power BI for data visualization and analysis. The RFID system will track student attendance in real-time, and Power BI will provide insights into attendance patterns, identify truant students, and track class performance.

**System Components**


**RFID Tags and Readers:** RFID tags will be assigned to each student. When a student enters the classroom, their RFID tag will be scanned by a reader, which will record the student's attendance in a database.

**Google Sheets :** For live data collection and connection with Power Bi

**Power BI:** Power BI will be used to create reports and dashboards that visualize the attendance data. These reports and dashboards can be used to identify trends, patterns, and outliers in student attendance.
